        <p>Rick Astley is best known for his song "Never Gonna Give You Up", which he released when he was 21 in 1987. He is from Lancaster England, even though he is now a world reconginzed singer, he never wanted to sing or play an instruments. In 2007 he rose to fame again, but not for a new song. His classic song from 1987 "Never Gonna Give You Up" became a meme. It was an important part of meme culture, which is stilling being used to this day. During this stage, memes sucked and Rick Astley was a breath of fresh air. Rick Rolling is one of the most innocent memes.</p>
